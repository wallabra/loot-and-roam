# Debug Assets

Those assets are designed to aid in visualizing internal aspects of the game,
to aid in development and debugging. They're also useful placeholders, to be
able to implement in-game objects before their final assets are finished.

If you spot one of those debug assets in your game, without actually enabling
debug mode, please [send a bug report](codeberg.org/GameCircular/loot-and-roam/issues)!
