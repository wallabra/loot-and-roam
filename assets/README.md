# Game Assets

Files used by Loot & Roam to populate the world and give it shape and sound.

There files are differentiated from those in the
[asset workspace](../asset_workspace/) because:

* Files here are **necessary** in order to populate Loot & Roam, and therefore
   *must* be packaged with the game, unlike those in the workspace.

* Files in the workspace are often used to **generate** the final assets, which,
  in turn, themselves lay in this file tree.
