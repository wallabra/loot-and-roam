//! # Loot & Roam common code.
//!
//! This contains primarily the simulation code, which is used primarily server-side,
//! but is also used by the client for client-side prediction (CSP).
//!
//! Bevy is the engine used to keep track of game state. However, some simulation
//! systems are their own self-contained Resources, rather than components or systems.
//! This is for performance reasons.
//!
//! A player can load a single island at a time. There are two types of islands:
//!
//! * Bases: those are the meat and potatoes of the game, where players spawn in to loot
//!   the props/buildings and the ships therein.
//!
//!   Here is where all the physics and combat happens.
//!
//! * Towns: presnted as an intermission screen (either a menu or a map with clickable
// !  buildings that enter menus, depending on client settings), where players can
// !  modify their ships and manage their inventory.
// !
// !  Being a sort of non-game state, towns are made interesting by means of an
// !  economic simulation.
